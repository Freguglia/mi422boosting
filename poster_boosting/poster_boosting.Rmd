## Conceito do Boosting

* Combinar diversos preditores fracos em um classificador muito poderoso.
* Alguma coisa
* Outra coisa

## How to use this package

### Installation and updates {.fullwidth}

1. `devtools::install_github("bbucior/drposter", dep=FALSE)` (or `install_local` on a downloaded copy) to install/update the package
2. In RStudio, you can find the format listed as a template under the "New R Markdown" wizard, or use the command line.
3. Template files are cached in `drposter_files/` to decouple your poster from the installed package version.  Use `drposter_update` to resync them.

### Customizing the template

* Avoid modifying `drposter_files/`
* Indirectly override those rules in your own `custom.css` or equivalent
  * Easier to see and share your changes
  * Decouples your modifications from the base drposter styles
* Customize the format of the bibliography[@rstudio-bib;@stackoverflow-refs] using a CSL style[@csl-github]

### Export

* View and "print as PDF" from Chrome[@firefox-footnote]  <!-- Note: the footnote used to be a bibtex "note," but the default ACS template doesn't include that field -->
* Be sure to save a PDF (and possibly html with `self_contained: true`) to archive your project at the end, in case there are changes in pandoc, rmarkdown, etc.
* You can also render the poster in other formats, such as a `github_document` or `revealjs::revealjs_presentation`


## Reproducible research

### Directly include plots

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

### Directly include stats

```{r cars_demo}
summary(cars)
```



# {.col-2}

## Customizable themes

Note the features for theming.  If you had a special class attached to the .level1 or .slides/theme, you could use a general descendent selector to automatically get theming support, then break up these details into separate theme files.
